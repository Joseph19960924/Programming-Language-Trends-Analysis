# Programming-Language-Trends-Analysis


This repository contains a data science project focused on analyzing trends in programming language popularity over time. The project explores the search interest scores for three prominent programming languages - Python, Java, and C++ - over a five-year period from April 2019 to April 2024. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend analysis, forecasting, and insights for stakeholders in the software development community.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to provide insights into the popularity trends of Python, Java, and C++ and anticipate future developments in the software development landscape. The analysis involves:

- Data Collection: Obtaining weekly search interest scores for the programming languages from April 2019 to April 2024.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring trends and patterns in programming language popularity over time.
- Forecasting: Utilizing time series forecasting techniques to predict future popularity trends.
- Insights and Recommendations: Providing actionable insights and recommendations for stakeholders based on the analysis.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks documenting the data science pipeline, including preprocessing, EDA, forecasting, and insights.
- `plots/`: Visualizations generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.
